# Tax Gpt Assignment

This assignment is due by April 30th, 2024

## Description

This assignment aims to design and implement a full-stack web application that facilitates the uploading and parsing of a W-2 form.
The web application should let users chat and ask specific questions about their W-2 data.
For example,

“How much did I pay the the social security?”
‘What is my gross and net income?’
“How can I maximize tax deductions? What type of deductions are available to me?”

Applicants are expected to build a basic frontend, backend, and database.
The application should integrate a low-parameter LLM to manage interactive querying on the W-2 information.
This assignment is designed to assess your coding, system design, and integration skills and is expected to take up to 5 to 7 hours of work,
which can be distributed over the week as needed.
Additionally, we have created a folder with filled sample W2s for you to test your application.

> NOTE: Only submissions that successfully implement all the listed requirements will be accepted and considered for the position.

### Requirements

- Integration of a low-parameter LLM server (i.e. OpenAI vision model, open-source etc.) to enable chat functionality with the W-2 data. - [x]
- A functional database to store user and W-2 data.-[x]
- Frontend developed using ReactJS, NextJS preferred - [x]
- Backend service created with Django/Python preferred - [x]
- Docker implementation with a single 'compose up' command.
- Deploy the project to a web-hosting site like Vercel or Netlify
- Basic initialization scripts for creating users, loading data, etc.
- A comprehensive README file documenting the setup, dependencies, and usage instructions.
- Error handling - [x]
- Hide social security number - [x]

### Wishlist

- Enhanced UI/UX design.
- Unit Testing
- Show social security number after the text confirmation
- Implementation of security measures such as file encryption and user authentication.
- The Docker setup is configured for both development and production environments.
- Use of a vector database and integration of a knowledge graph for advanced data handling.

### Tools

- Open-source LLMs for chat functionality.
- OCR tools for parsing uploaded W-2 forms.
- AI coding assistants (i.e. ChatGPT, Github Copilot, Perplexity etc.)
- Python & Node js libraries
- Utilization of open-source GitHub repositories (Ensure all used repos and tools are credited in the README file).
